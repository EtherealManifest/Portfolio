            Weather machine is a group project that was used as the final project in my software engineering class.
            in this app, the user enters a location and data on the current weather at that location is returned.The 
            user can then compare locations, and the relationship between all of the attributes is displayed.

        <ul class="trivia">
            <li>
                Each Location has it's information on it's own dedicated tile, making the information easy to understand 
            </li>
            <li>
                Up to ten locations can be added, and this was to enable the project to have a reasonable scope and to be able 
                to show all of the information on one screen
            </li>
            <li>
                There are a total of 26 pieces of information returned from the API, and the user can choose any combination of 
                those to show for each location, making the comparison very well defined.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a single-click solution to removing all tiles. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Cookies are invoked to save the most recent state of the API, and those locations are immediatley
                displayed when the page is loaded. THis is to make repeated location searches easier for the user
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a glossary page that definies some of the more complicated terms for the user. 
            </li>
            <li>
                All of the pictures in the app were made by Me! I'm very proud of them!
