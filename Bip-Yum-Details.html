            Bip-Yum is the first (and only) game that I have developed to date. In the game, you play as the 
            slime, who goes from scenario to scenario completing whatever tasks are required of him. It is a 
            rather simple game, but I have put my hear and soul (and 100+ hours) into this game. In addition
            to all of the coding, I also did all the spritework and made all the buttons. This project was 
            used as my senior project in college, and the inspiration behind it was that I wanted to do an 
            entire project from the ground up to understand the full process of game development. This game
            is the realization of that idea.

            <li>
                Each scenario's background is randomly generated based on tiles. 
            </li>
            <li>
                New scenarios can be added on the fly, and the menu is automatically reformatted, and a new button 
                is created to accommodate it. 
            </li>
            <li>
                The sword swing is smooth because it uses an function to generate its rotation and position
                mathematically, instead of having to design each frame.
            </li>
            <li>
                The system was entirely designed by me. I imported modules like Pygame to build the project on, but the 
                entirety of the spritework and programming is mine.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the desert scenario, the tumbleweeds' position is determined algebraically using a function.
                I can input the height I want them to 'bounce' to, and the program will smoothly make them bounce
                that high.
            </li>
            <li>
                the clouds on the title screen scroll, and the direction can be changed. They continuously 
                generate, so no matter how long the user is on the title screen, they always have pretty clouds to look at!
