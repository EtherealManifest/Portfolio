            Celestial Integration was used as the final project for my Advanced Python Class. 
            It connects to Stellarium, a free, open-source Planetarium software. As long as the app is running
            and has the Remote-control module engaged, this program can pull data from the app as well as 
            control some of it's properties. The Web app is faster than the actual app, because it does not need
            to render any of the stars, just read and manipulate their data.

                The starmap is generated at runtime using matplotLib, mapping the star using the azimuth and altitude of the star

                THis app was my first delve into a Framework, in this case, Flask
            </li>
            <li>
                The API itself hosts data on the local machine, meaning that data is not visible to other devices. 
            </li>
            <li>
                This project was also my first project that I designed with an API. I used ChatGPT to help understand the 
                nuance of Flask and designing the actual style for the page.
